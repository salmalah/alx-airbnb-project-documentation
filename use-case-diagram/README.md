# Airbnb Clone Backend: Use Case Diagram

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Visualize system interactions using a **use case diagram** that captures how users and the system interact with key functionalities like user registration, property booking, and payments.

---

## ðŸ“š Introduction
Use case diagrams help in understanding the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and the system itself. For the Airbnb Clone backend, the use case diagram will represent:

- Main actors (Guests, Hosts, Admins)  
- System functionalities (User Management, Property Listings, Booking, Payments, Reviews, Notifications)  
- Relationships between actors and system features  

This diagram serves as a blueprint for backend development and clarifies the responsibilities of each actor.
